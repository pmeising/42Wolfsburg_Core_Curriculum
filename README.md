# 42Wolfsburg_Core_Curriculum

Level 0:
- *Libft*:
         -  First C project to get familiar with String manipulation and list iteration.
         
Level 1:
- *B2BR*:
                  First look into Virtual Machines, Linux OS, System Administration and Bash Scripting. "This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of                     virtualization. You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end                     of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules."
- *get_next_line*: 
                  "This project will not only allow you to add a very convenient function to your collection, but it will also make you learn a highly interesting new                       concept in C programming: static variables."
- *ft_printf*: 
                  "You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of                moderate difficulty."

Level 2:
- *PushSwap*: 
                   "This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll                      have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
                           optimized data sorting."
- *Pipex*: 
                  "This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you already know by using it in your program." Processes and pipes.
- *So_long*: 
                  "This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites,
                  and some other very basic gameplay elements."
    
   
Level 3:
    - *Minishell*: 
                           "This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash.
You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors."
    - *Philosopher*: 
                           "In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes."
    
Level 4:
    - *C++*: 
                           "The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming. This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C. Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard."
    - *cub3D*: 
                           "This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way."
    - *net_practise*: 
                           "This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking." Basics of networking - that's it.


Level 5:
    - *C++9*: 
                           ""
    - *Inception*: 
                           ""
    - *ft_irc*: 
                           ""
    
   
Level 6:
    - *Transcendence*: 
                           ""
